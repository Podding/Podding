# Inheriting Methods

Models can inherit return values for methods (and therefore attributes) from other models: If a method returns nil, the return value of the same method from another "parent" model is used.

## Usage

```
# In "child" model
inherits_from: :parent_method, :method1, :method2, ...
```

The ```:parent_method``` is usually generated by ```belongs_to```.

Beware! ```inherits_from``` must be called *after* ```belongs_to``` (because it uses the ```parent_method``` defines by it) and before any other methods are defined in the model, attributes included.

## Example

```
class ChildModel < Model
  belongs_to :ParentModel, :parent_model
  inherits_from: :parent_model, :my_attribute, :my_method

  attribute :my_attribute # this attribute is not present in the yaml header

  def my_method
    nil
  end
end

class ParentModel < Model
  attribute :my_attribute
  def my_method
    "hello there"
  end
end
```
